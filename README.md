# RNA-seq-data-analysis-workflow

A workflow for analysing RNA-seq data, aimed at new users who want to understand the methods available. This workshop has been modified from the [Genomics Aotearoa RNA-seq data analysis workshop](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/RNA-seq-data-analysis-workflow) to be run in one day at the Otago Bioinformatics Spring School.
